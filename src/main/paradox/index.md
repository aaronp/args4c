Args4c
======

Args4c (arguments for configuration) is intended to add some helpers and utilities for obtaining a typesafe configuration from user arguments.

The dependency on the typesafe config is 'provided', so should work with the typesafe config
already on your classpath (or, if there isn't one, you can bring one in)

## Releases

The latest version is 0.3.0, built for 2.11 and 2.12

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.github.aaronp" %% "args4c" % "0.3.0"
```
