Args4c is a utility for producing a typesafe config from command-line arguments, as well as some convenience methods for working with configurations such as:

 * providing flat config summaries
 * getting unique paths, json strings, filter/modify operations
 * encrypting/decrypting sensitive config entries
 * convenient overrides by default from environment variables
